# NeoIPC - Working together to improve Infection Prevention and Control practices in neonatal care settings

Here you can find publicly available source code related to the software and documentation of the [NeoIPC Project](https://neoipc.org).

As we are simultaneously building the tools and growing the network of people and partner sites, much of what you find here may be incomplete or lacking in documentation, but as the [NeoIPC Surveillance](https://neoipc.org/surveillance/) evolves we are beginning to seek external contributors and collaborations with open source friendly companies.

One of the first supporters of our open source work is [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), who are kindly supporting our translation efforts with their software, expertise and free hosting.

Please take a look at the [NeoIPC project hosted by Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/neoipc/) if you would like to contribute your language-specific knowledge to make the project accessible to important stakeholders for whom the English documentation is a barrier.
